Hello, I'm Loghman Samani! 
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Welcome to my GitHub profile! I'm a passionate bioinformatician  and computational biologist
currently   pursuing my master's degree in Technical Biology at the University of Stuttgart. 
Here,I explore the fascinating intersection of biology and technology, applying cutting-edge
computational methods to unravel the mysteries of life.


About Me
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Field of Interest:
------------------

My primary focus is   on **bioinformatics**, with a specialization in 
**protein bioinformatics**. I delve into various aspects of this field, including protein
structure analysis, folding prediction, protein databases, evolutionary protein bioinformatics,
and more.


Computational Neuroscience: I'm also deeply intrigued by **computational neuroscience**,
especially neural networks and deep learning. I love applying these techniques to various
biological domains, seeking to understand the brain and its complexities.

Systems Biology: Another area of expertise is **systems biology**, where I harness the power 
of machine learning and deep learning models to decipher complex biological systems. I'm 
passionate about using data-driven approaches to gain insights into the intricate workings of
living organisms.



Collaboration
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

I'm enthusiastic about collaborating on bioinformatics projects that leverage 
**machine learning methods** to tackle diverse biological problems. If you're 
working on such projects or have ideas you'd like to explore together, please 
don't hesitate to reach out! Let's combine our knowledge and expertise to make 
meaningful contributions to the world of biology.
